<h3>FAQ</h3>

    <li> <strong> What is GetYO? </strong> </li>
      <p>Our team has had some troubles throughout our lives deciding between
         two or more decisions.  Whether it be a product we’re looking at, or just an idea,
         we’re unsure which to pick.  Often times we turn to the person next to us,
         but that’s only one person and generally will say whatever they think you want them to hear. </p>
      <p> As a result we created GetYO.  Our goal is to provide individuals the ability
          to ask for an opinion on something they’re curious about, and quickly receive
          feedback from real people on what they would suggest.</p>
    <li> <strong> How do I use GetYO? </strong> </li>
      <p>There are two main purposes of the app - get an opinion or give an opinion </p>
      <dl>
        <dt><i> Get an opinion <br></br></i></dt>
        <dd>Through getting an opinion you follow the create a new post prompt.
            Pick a target group, either your friends, a specific private group,
            or the public at large in a specific topic.  Next, give some details about what you would like to ask.
            After you submit the question, it will be posted in or to whichever group you selected.<br></br></dd>
        <dd>As responses are given, data will be made available through bar graphs in a poll format.
            Additionally, if you choose, a comment page will be made available in which
            participants will be able to comment on the question or products themselves.<br></br></dd>
        <dt><i> Give an opinion <br></br></i></dt>
        <dd>As a responder you’re able to give an opinion on specific groups of questions,
            to your friends, or sometimes you’ll be picked as a specific person.
            If one of your friends posts a question, or you are part of a private group,
            you will receive a notification that you have the opportunity to participate in a new poll.<br></br></dd>
        <dd>Upon providing a response you will be given feedback on what percentage
            of people selected the options provided by the requester.
            You subsequently have the option to be taken to a comment page in which you can discuss the topic further.<br></br></dd>
        <dd>If you choose not to respond to the opinion,
            but rather just see the results or comment, that too is an option available in the question page.<br></br></dd>

    <li> <strong> Does the app cost anything? </strong> </li>
      <p> <strong> No! </strong>  We believe that people should be able to get opinions and
          help on making the decisions they’re debating on.  We do not believe that people
          should have to pay in order to see what people recommend.   </p>
    <li> <strong> Do I need to provide any personal information? </strong> </li>
      <p> No.  We highly recommend that you provide your gender, age and interests
          through our questionnaire in order for us to provide you with topics that may interest you.
          That being said, you are free to skip the questionnaire and never provide such information. </p>
    <li> <strong> Why do I have friends in this app? </strong> </li>
      <p> Friends allow you to keep up-to-date with what they’re thinking about
          doing or buying through their posts.  Friends also allow you to ask opinions
          of your friends only, rather than asking the public as a whole. </p>
    <li> <strong> Can I make friends with people who aren’t already my friends on other social medias? </strong> </li>
      <p> Yes!  We highly encourage that you make new friends who have similar interests,
          or possibly you share similar opinions.  This will allow you to ask them for
          opinions easily in the future.   </p>
